risks:
  - id: RISK-001
    description: PlayCanvas learning curve delays Sprint 3
    probability: medium
    impact: high
    status: open
    mitigation: Allocate extra research time, use official examples

  - id: RISK-002
    description: Physics tuning takes longer than estimated
    probability: medium
    impact: medium
    status: open
    mitigation: Allocate dedicated tuning time, use configurable parameters

  - id: RISK-003
    description: Stress calculation bugs hard to debug
    probability: medium
    impact: high
    status: open
    mitigation: Comprehensive unit tests, visual debug overlays

  - id: RISK-004
    description: Performance drops below 60 FPS
    probability: medium
    impact: high
